# TNT Faces
Resource packs for Minecraft Java and Bedrock which replaces the TNT label with emoticon faces.

For Java, move one or all of the zip files into AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/resourcepacks

For Bedrock, simply open the mcpack file and it will open in Minecraft. To change the face, go to the resource packs in world settings (or global resources if your using it globally) and click on the gear icon to switch between the faces.
