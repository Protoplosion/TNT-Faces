# TNT-Chan Bedrock Resource Pack
This Resource pack replaces the Creeper mob with TNT-Chan with custom model and animations.
This pack is inside the Bedrock folder. Simply download and open. Minecraft will open if not already and install the resource pack.
The design of TNT-Chan is based on [This Post](https://redd.it/17oloos/) by [u/playror](https://www.reddit.com/user/playror/).

Resource packs for Minecraft Java and Bedrock which replaces the TNT label with emoticon faces.

For Java, hit Windows+R and in the Run prompt, type %appdata% and move one or all packs into .minecraft/resourcepacks
For Bedrock, open the mcpack file and it will open in Minecraft. To change the face, go to the resource packs in world settings (or global resources if your using it globally) and click on the gear icon to switch between the faces.
